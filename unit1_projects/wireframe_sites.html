	<p><a href="http://www.thebolditalic.com/">The Bold Italic</a> is tyring to solve the problem of how to present fun, irreverent blog post content in a visually interesting and pleasant way. They have elected to arrange recent posts in a tile-like format, so that the users whole screen is taken up by rectangles of different sizes that lead to a new post. There are many visual challenges, including how to space these rectangles, where to position the title and info about the post in relation to its image, and which posts to display in which size rectangle.</p>
