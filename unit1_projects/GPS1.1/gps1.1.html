            <h2>Pair Programming</h2>
            <p>            
                Pair programming is valuable because it externalizes the thought process in coding and it opens these thoughts to constructive collaboration. One thing we see as being really helpful with pair-programming is being able to bounce ideas off of somebody while you are in the mode of writing software. It is very easy to get stuck in a loop and get suck on something really small. It really helps smooth out bumps in the road that can otherwise be very valuable. Pairing helps you learn from the challenges and learn from the people, and it is a great way of picking up more skills than you could on your own.

                When pairing with another programmer, it is important to discuss expectations, styles of learning and thinking, and personal goals for the session. You will want to decide which person is driving, and which is navigating. The driver is at the keyboard, typing the code the navigator dictates - it is often said they are "pressing the gas pedal" so to speak. The navigator is the one that steers - he or she is dictating code, thinking a few steps ahead to plan out next steps.

            <h2>Our Reflection</h2>
            <p>
                Samantha: Pairing is a great way to learn from other people's knowledge. Everyone has things they are good at, and things they struggle more with, and by collaborating with someone else, you get the chance to address your knowledge gaps and help others with theirs. One thing that could have gone smoother is using Stypi - we ended up both using Sublime on our own computer since previewing changes is much faster and easier that way. Overall, it was a great first guided pairing experience!

                Marlon: In a pair-programming setting, there are two brains dissecting one problem, which is of great value and help for each individual; however, because the individuals pairing up can be so different, one should be conscious of this when pair programming in order to maximize its benefit. For example, advanced programmers would probably be more helpful in the navigator position than beginning programers. On the other hand, sometimes working too rigidly within the roles can get in the way of exploring alternate solutions for the particular programming problem. All in all, pair-programming is pretty beneficial for the individual, as well as the pair.
