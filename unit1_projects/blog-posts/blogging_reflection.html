				<h1>A blog post about blogging, in which I reflect on reflecting.</h1>
				<h2>September 14, 2014</h2>
				<p>Dev Bootcamp emphasizes self-reflection as a part of its engineering empathy curriculum. All this means is that they think it is important to be in touch with how you are feeling and reacting to situations, so that you can be a better peer and colleague to those you are working with. In the past, I haven't made a habit of reflecting on my own state of mind, and my experience in DBC so far has proven to me how important those explorations can be.</p>
				<p>We were asked to reflect on a lot of things. Some of them were technical - how did my approach to this challenge work? Did I learn anything new or were any technical concepts clarified? But some of them were more general, like how I felt about the challenge, what I enjoyed or didn't enjoy, and how confident I felt with the concepts. Taking a step back from coding to think about how I was approaching the questions was really eye opening, and I'm glad to have had the chance to do it.</p>
				<p>This blog post is also about the process of blogging. I've never been a journal keeper, but I liked having the routine of posting to my blog twice a week during Phase 0. I am a definite perfectionist when it comes to the design of the blog - I spent easily 4 hours on Friday just redesigning some minor elements in terms of layout and styling. While I have occasionaly found CSS to be frustrating, it's immensely rewarding when you finally get it right. (This gif sums it up pretty well:)</p>
