				<h1>Week 8 Cultural: Conflict</h1>
				<h2>September 7, 2014</h2>
				<p>It's interesting to think about how I've dealt with conflict in my life. In general, the conflicts that come to mind generally occured during times when I was under a lot of emotional stress. One conflict in particular (which was really more like a series of conflicts) occurred during freshman year of college. Early in the year, I befriended someone, and we became very close. Over the course of the year, I discovered that this person had been making up lies about me to our mutual friends and talking about me behind my back. The lies were petty, but egregious, and I was completely caught off guard.</p> 
				<p>Needless to say, I felt extremely betrayed and disillusioned. I took this person's actions personally, and started to mistrust our other friends too. To deal with the situation and the pain I felt, I essentially broke off contact with the friend, tried to avoid situations where I knew they would be present, and tried to forget about the whole strange situation. I don't think my actions made the situation better, but they did protect me from getting hurt by this person again. The betrayal was so shocking to me that I think it made it difficult for me to become close to new friends afterwards.</p>
				<p>If I could go back, I'm not sure what I would do differently. Perhaps I should have confronted this person more directly to find out why exactly they would do such a cruel thing. I'm sure they had reasons, but to me, it always seemed extremely out of the blue. If I had taken the time to talk with the person, maybe I would have learned some things about their life that caused them to act this way. Since the incidents, I have suspected that this person was extremely insecure and jealous, and that their method of coping was to say whatever they thought people wanted to hear, regardless of its truth. Now that I am a few years removed from this conflict, I can tell that I have definitely learned to be more empathetic and try to see the world from someone else's perspective, particularly when their behavior is odd and destructive.
