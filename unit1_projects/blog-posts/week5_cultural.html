					<p>Pair programming was one of the most daunting things for me at the beginning of Phase 0. There are a couple reasons for this. First, I was experiencing extreme "imposter syndrome" symptoms, and I was worried that I'd be exposed for the phony, wanna-be programmer I felt I was. Second, I've never been particularly fond of working as a part of a group - I always find I do better working solo, and finding out that I was a concrete sequential thinker underscored that working in groups doesn't come easily for me.</p> 
					<p>Nonetheless, I've found pairing to be a mostly rewarding and helpful experience so far. It was really rewarding to click well with a pair today and flow through a challenge with ease, filling in one another's knowledge gaps seamlessly. There have definitely been a few times when I've felt panicked, because I had no idea what to do to make the code work. Sometimes when I feel put on the spot and under pressure, I find that my brain shuts down, and I just hear static. Anxiety has been something I have struggled with for a lot of my life, and sometimes it can creep into pair sessions when I feel lost or confused. I know that I need to work on explaining my ideas verbally to my pair. Practicing doing this in sessions has been extremely helpful so far.</p>
					<p>I finally got a bunch of feedback just today, and was really excited (and nervous) to hear what my pairs have thought of our sessions so far. Before I read the feedback, I was expecting to receive medium ratings on people "benefitting technically" from having me in the pair, and on "expressing myself clearly and concisely", since both of these are things I struggle with. All my feedback was very kind, and people have seemed to appreciate my focused and methodical approach to challenges. As I suspected, my lowest ratings have been in the two categories mentioned, and those are things I will continue to work on and improve as much as possible. In terms of writing feedback, I have found it challenging to come up with specific things to suggest people improve for next time. I have been trying to take some notes during the session to remind myself about what worked well (or didn't) for when I write feedback later.</p> 
					<p>Overall, I'm really glad about the emphasis placed on pairing at DBC. Initially, I was intimidated and wasn't sure of how effective it would really be, but I have certainly benefitted from pairing, both technically and culturally, so far.</p>
