				<h1>Week 3 Cultural</h1>
				<h2>August 2nd, 2014</h2>
				<p>According to the test, my thinking style is about half concrete sequential and half concrete random. As a concrete thinker, I enjoy order, logical sequences, and predictability. Being able to experiment and "prove" things to myself via testing is the best way for me to solidify concepts. A structured learning environment is best for me. I sometimes find it difficult to work in groups, or in a situation where expectations are not clear. Ambiguity is a challenge for me.</p>
				<p>I think this description of my thinking style is really accurate based on my experience so far in DBC. I find it desirable to break a problem up into small parts and run mini tests to determine how each section of the code is working, rather than think broadly about how it all fits together. The biggest challenge for me so far was conceptualizing a code mission in this week's solo challenge, and I think I struggled with that because it was much less concrete. It required thinking in a much more creative and abstract way about what constitutes objects in JavaScript, and how I might define some objects to interact with one another in some way. Other challenges have been when the instructions were not clear - I find myself feeling frustrated when I am unsure about what the expectations are for a certain challenge or release.</p>
				<p>I think I can use my thinking style to my advantage at DBC by breaking large challenges up into concrete, smaller chunks that I can test. I can also try pairing with more abstract thinkers and use each others' unique skills and thinking styles to accomplish different parts of a challenge. Knowing what works well and what doesn't is a really eye opening experience for me - I am constantly seeing examples of my thinking style in my reaction to challenges and struggles, and it's rewarding to be able to take a step back and understand why I am reacting in a certain way.</p>
				<p>I think one way to help me think more abstractly is to write more pseudocode and general code planning ahead of time. Rather than diving right in to coding, by taking a step back and planning out what I'd like a script to do, I'll be exercising my abstract thinking and improving that aspect of my thinking style. Also, I know that constantly pairing and working in groups at DBC will help me learn to work better in group settings, be able to deal with less clear expectations, and be more flexible about my approach to problems. </p>
