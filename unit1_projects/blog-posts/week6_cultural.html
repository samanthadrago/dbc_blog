			<h1>Week 6 Cultural: Stereotype Threat</h1>
			<h2>August 24, 2014</h2>
			<p>During my first week at college, we were asked to take placement tests in various subjects. Throughout high school, I excelled at math and science, and planned on majoring in physics at Harvard. But when I sat down to the test, in a large auditorium full of high school valedictorians, math geniuses, and probable future Nobel prize winners, I could feel the panic rising in my stomach. Who was I to think that I was smart enough to take the same math or physics classes as these people? I performed much more poorly on the test than I had anticipated. I took my performance as a sign that I wasn't cut out for majoring in math or science, rather than as the example of stereotype threat it probably was.</p>
			<p>Stereotype threat is a phenomenon first identified by social psychology researchers in the 1990s. It posits that minorities perform more poorly on a task when they are concerned they will confirm a negative stereotype about the group they identify with. The original experiment gave the same test to two groups of students. One group was given a test that indicated it was a measure of intelligence; the other group was told the test was a "problem-solving task." White and African American students performed comparably when told they were facing a "problem solving task." But African American students who were told the task was a measure of intelligence performed more poorly than their white counterparts, arguably due to stress factors related to possibly confirming a negative stereotype about the intelligence of African Americans as a group.</p>
			<p>Even when it seems as if you are performing a task free of the judgment of others, your brain is wired to anticipate (and possibly worry about) how your performance will reflect on you socially. The ever present "chorus of voices" in your head, put there by years of living in a human society, can also impose its own sort of stereotype threat. I have certainly experienced this many times before as a woman pursuing a career in a field dominated by men. I find that my own inner thoughts, telling me I'm not good enough, that I should give up, that I don't have a "natural" aptitude for engineering, are a constant threat to my confidence and, indirectly, my success.</p>
			<p>As I begin my career as a programmer, one of the biggest challenges for me will be to recognize when I or my peers are experiencing stereotype threat, and to learn how to cope with it. I think it's important to separate your objective assessment of skills and performance (both your own and those of your peers) from any type of moral or value-based judgment. For example, I often catch myself getting caught in a negative thought loop when I get stuck on a coding challenge. I'll find myself thinking "Why is this so hard for me? What is wrong with me that I can't figure this out? I must just not have a natural aptitude for this material." Instead of tying my self-worth to my performance on a particular minute of a particular day, I need to be better about objectively assessing how I've done, and not beating myself up if I'm having trouble.</p>
			<p>Stereotype threat, imposter syndrome, diversity in tech: these are issues that are really important to me, and I want to do my best to contribute to a positive, supportive, helpful environment in my Dev Bootcamp cohort. This may, at times, involve calling attention to behaviors or feedback that I think are contributing to stereotype threat. As with any type of critical feedback, I will do my best to make sure I am doing this in a constructive, helpful, and non-aggressive way. I'm grateful that we are writing and thinking about these issues before we even arrive - it makes me really hopeful and excited for phase 1 to begin.</p>
