				<h1>Week 8 Cultural: Asking the right questions</h1>
				<h2>September 14, 2014</h2>
				<p>If Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp has taught me anything, it's how much I DON'T know about web development. That's why asking questions is so important, both during DBC and in our future careers. As much as we'll learn in these next 9 weeks, there will be infinitely more that we still need to learn, and asking smart questions of our colleagues will be crucial to our success. But what makes a good question that a more experienced programmer won't mind answering?</p>
				<p>During the course of Googling answers to my coding questions in the past few weeks, I've come across numerous Stack Overflow question and answers. If you're not familiar, Stack Overflow is a community of programmers where users can ask and answer one another's questions. I was at first struck by how MEAN some of the responses were to seemingly reasonable questions! People would reply angrily if they felt that particular question had already been answered, or if the person didn't do a reasonable amount of research before posting, or if the question was unclear.</p>
				<p>This was really intimidating to me at first, and I wondered why these people got so offended by harmless (yet perhaps not well thought-out) questions. After reading through Stack Overflow's <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">help article</a> on how to ask good questions, I understand. They suggest the following tips for asking great questions:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Do your reasearch on the topic before posting.</li>
					<li>Make sure the title of your post gives enough information.</li> 
					<li>Write a summary of the question, including the relevant context.</li>
					<li>BE SPECIFIC about the problem you are having - don't just ask for general thoughts or opinions on a broad topic.</li>
					<li>Include code snippits to help others reproduce the issue.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Personally, I think I have gotten a lot better at asking questions, simply because I was on the receiving end of hundreds of questions each week as the client services director at a software company. I constantly fielded vague, impossible to understand questions from customers. It was easy to get frustrated when customers did not provide enough detail, did not search through our extensive resources for the answer first, or left out important context details that I needed to help them. Because of my experience as a question-answerer, I understand how important it is to ask specific, clear, brief questions.</p>
				<p>When I asked questions on the Google Group during Phase 0, I tried to make sure they were specific, targeted, to the point, and included examples. I struggled with one jQuery challenge, in which I wasn't fully understanding how to select the HTML elements I needed. Instead of just writing that, I wrote "I'm having a hard time with the jQuery challenge, specifically Release 2, where we have to use the html() method to set the second h1 text. Does anyone know if there is a way to use jQuery to select just that particular h1 without giving it a unique class or id first? Like, selecting an element within a parent element that has a particular class? Thanks!﻿" I referenced a specific part of a specific challenge, and gave an idea of how I understood the functionality to work. The answers I got from peers indicated that the question was clear and well-understood.</p>
				<p>As with all skills, asking good questions is something I know I will get better at as I have more practice. And considering how much I still have to learn, I'm sure I'll be getting a lot of practice!</p>
