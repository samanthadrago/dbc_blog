			<h1>Week 3 Technical: JavaScript: The Good, the Bad, the Ugly.</h1>
			<p>JavaScript is an extremely popular programming language, and has many loyal and devoted followers. Despite it's widespread use and legion of apostles, there is also a surprising amount of hate heaped onto the language. So what's the real story? Is JavaScript the be all and end all of web development, or is it a poorly conceived mess of a language that should be forgotten once and for all? As a JS n00b, I didn't know the answers, so I did some research to find out!</p>

			<p>First, I asked some web developer friends what they thought about JavaScript's popularity. What did they like and dislike about the language? Both developers I spoke with first mentioned browser compatibility - JavaScript is built in and compatible with every major internet browser, making it extremely easy to write and test code. If you want to incorporate interactive elements in your web page (think a pop up dialog or a prompt for user input), 99% of the time, you will be working with JavaScript. The developers at my previous company said that not only do they use JavaScript in the browser, but they also use it on the server side with something called node.js. Writing in the same language in the client and server sides creates a more seamless development environment and means they don't have to constantly translate between different languages.</p>

			<p>One developer I spoke with mentioned an important book in the world of JS: "JavaScript: The Good Parts" by Douglas Crockford. The idea behind "The Good Parts" is that, admittedly, there are some terrible aspects to JavaScript, but if you can focus on and utilize just the good parts, you can really get a lot out of the language and make it work for just about any use. </p>

			<p>After getting opinions from a few friends, I did some more research online to see what people like and dislike about JavaScript.</p>

		<h3>JavaScript: The Good Parts</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>It's built into all browsers.</strong> As my friends said, JavaScript already works seamlessly with all major web browsers.</li>
			<li><strong>You can also use it server-side.</strong> With node.js, you can use JavaScript as your server-side language instead of having to use another language.</li>
			<li><strong>It's easy to learn.</strong> The barrier for entry with JavaScript is very low, since you can write and run code using just a text editor and a web browser!</li>
			<li><strong>It's object oriented.</strong> Object Oriented Programming languages emphasize creating and manipulating objects, and are very popular in web development.</li>
			<li><strong>AJAX makes it seamless.</strong> Using AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML), your web page can ask the server for information without needing to leave or reload the page. Nearly every popular web app uses AJAX requests to load new information to the page without a full refresh.</li>
			<li><strong>There are tons of library extensions.</strong> Using libraries, you can take advantage of dozens of complex functions that you can add on by simply adding a line to the top of your code. jQuery is one of the most noteworthy JavaScript libraries, and adds tons of functionality without you needing to reinvent the wheel.</li>
			<li><strong>There's a vibrant open source community.</strong> Open source is an important part of web development, and due to JavaScript's popularity, there is tons of open source work being done in that space.</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>JavaScript: The Bad Parts</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>The name.</strong> JavaScript has the name Java right in it, but it isn't at all related to the language Java. This is confusing for n00bs who get them confused!</li>
			<li><strong>Dependence on global variables.</strong> JS requires the creation of global variables, which gets extremely tricky when you begin referencing multiple scripts. If one of your variables shares a name with one on a different script, you'll get error messages.</li>
			<li><strong>Many falsy values.</strong> Though I admittedly don't understand exactly what is bad about having too many values evaluate to false, many people cited this as a drawback to JavaScript.</li>
			<li><strong>No distinction between floats and integers</strong> Many languages distinguish between floating point values (decimals) and integers (whole numbers). JavaScript doesn't, which leads to some quirky behavior and need for Math methods when doing arithmetic.</li>
			<li><strong>It's not the most semantic</strong> JavaScript isn't an inherently readable language, like Ruby or Python. This means developers need to use lots of comments to explain the code to colleagues (and their future selves!) to understand why they did things a certain way.</li>
		</ul>
