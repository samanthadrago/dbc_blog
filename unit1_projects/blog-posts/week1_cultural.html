					<h1>Week 1 Cultural</h1>
					<h2>July 20th, 2014</h2>
				<p>I can already tell that Dev Bootcamp is going to push me out of my comfort zone, both intellectually and culturally. Shereef talks about how the "imposter syndrome" can hobble a student's experience, as they are constantly plagued by worry that they aren't good enough as everyone else. I tend to have a negative internal monalogue that can include thoughts about being less worthy than others, particularly if I'm struggling with something that many people seem to grasp very quickly. Karim described this in a previous video as a self-attacking defense mechanism, which I certainly relate to. Not only with DBC be an extraordinary technical challenge for me, but it will also force me to address this internal monalogue and turn my thoughts and feelings into productive and positive ones, even when faced with a seemingly insurmountable problem.</p>
				<p>I feel very lucky that DBC is such a positive and supportive community, as evidenced even in this first week by boots' willingness to help one another out, troubleshoot bugs, pair up on tricky challenges, and generally offer supportive advice. It is clear already that everyone is at a totally different level tehcnically at this point in their careers, so the challenge for me will be accepting that I may not be the best, and open myself up to learning from people who are willing to teach me. We will all be working together to make a messy dish in the kitchen, each of us contributing his or her unique perspective and insights. I am nervous and excited and think it's going to be a truly life-changing experience.</p>
