					<h1>Week 7 Cultural: DBC Values</h1>
					<h2>August 29, 2014</h2>

					<p>When I think of times in my life I have been most proud and content, the following values come to mind:</p>
					<ul>
					<li>Self-knowledge</li>
					<li>Self-respect</li>
					<li>Stability</li>
					<li>Confidence</li>
					<li>Enthusiasm</li>
					</ul>
					<p>I think it's telling that two of the values I chose are introspective - self-knowledge and self-respect. These values are important to me because I know I am not always the best at identifying and grappling with my own feelings. Being self-reflective is one of the first steps toward being empathetic toward those around you, which is why these values are so important to me.</p>
					<p>In an ideal world, I would say that I try to live up to these values as much as possible every day. Realistically, though, I often prioritize other things, like being comfortable or complacent, when things get too difficult. I would say that of the five values above, I try the hardest to incorporate self-knowledge, self-respect, and confidence, while enthusiasm and stability may take a backseat to other more pressing concerns.</p>
					<p>An important part of self-reflection and empathy is being able to give advice when friends, colleagues, and family ask for it. When asked for advice, I try not to just tell someone what I think they should do. For example, earlier this week my friend was deciding between two job offers and asked my advice on which one she should accept. Rather than just telling her what to choose, I got her to talk about what she sees as the benefits and drawbacks of each, and contextualize those with her long term goals. The most important thing to consider when giving advice is to listen, first and foremost. People usually know what is best for them, and if you encourage them to talk the problem out, they will likely come to the conclusion that is best for the situation.</p>
					<p>Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp has involved a lot more introspection and "soul-searching" than I thought it would. Before DBC, I'd never really thought much about explicitly defining what my values are. Being asked to identify what values we consider important and how we think and react to stressors is an important first step toward being empathetic programmers. By being self-aware, I will be better able to recognize when I feel threatened (by stereotype threat or otherwise), confused, frustrated, angry, sad, or any number of other emotions that will certainly arise during the course of DBC. Practicing yoga, and the mindfulness that comes along with that practice, has also been extremely enlightening, encouraging me to acknowledge the thoughts and feelings that come up, but not attach value to them.</p>
